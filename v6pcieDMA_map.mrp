Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       14,053
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         4,011 out of  14,053   28%
    Number with an unused LUT:               4,178 out of  14,053   29%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       5,864 out of  14,053   41%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             976 out of 301,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
